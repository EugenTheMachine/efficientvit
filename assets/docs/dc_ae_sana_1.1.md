# DC-AE-SANA-1.1

We released DC-AE-f32c32-SANA-1.1: [efficientvit format](https://huggingface.co/mit-han-lab/dc-ae-f32c32-sana-1.1), [diffusers format](https://huggingface.co/mit-han-lab/dc-ae-f32c32-sana-1.1-diffusers). It has the same encoder as DC-AE-f32c32-SANA-1.0 while having a slightly better decoder. Without training, it can be applied to all diffusion models trained with DC-AE-f32c32-SANA-1.0, including SANA models.
